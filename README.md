GoalBond was born out of a personal need â€” I wanted a simple, distraction-free space to set goals, track progress, and even keep tabs on the shows Iâ€™m watching. 
Existing tools felt bloated or too simple, so I built my own.

With GoalBond you can...
- Create and keep track of goals in one clean dashboard.
- Track your watching progress for your favourite TV series.
- Form groups to share goals with friends or teams.
- Manage your account and personal details with ease.

### Features

- Dashboard: see all your goals at a glance.
- Goal creation: add, edit, and track progress easily.
- Groups: create or join groups to share goals with friends or teams.

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vue.js + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python + Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Deployment: Netlify (frontend) + Render (backend)

ðŸ”¥ Built out of love, shared for anyone who loves simple and effective goal tracking.
