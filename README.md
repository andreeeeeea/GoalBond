This platform is still in its developmental stage. I am actively working on it, but it is mostly finished, backend wise.

If it takes a bit for it to register your request, that's because I'm using the free tiers of Render and Netlify to host the website. 

### TO DO:
1. ~~Add functionality to the add group button (the one from the Account page works).~~ ADDED! 
2. Revamp account page. - In progres...
3. Add functionality for users to invite other users to their private groups - currently, that is not implemented.
